# Encrypted-K-Means-
Instruction to Run Code
	1) Clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/CrypTen repository 
	2) Enter inside this repository
	3) pip3 install .
	4) pip install matplotlib
	
Copy code menitoned in this repository
launcher.py launches Encrpyted K Means and main.py launches normal K means
World size for Encpryted K Means can be septup by --world_size argument in launcher.py
Epochs and K(cluster size ) value can also be set , for mall customer dataset optimal value is 5
kmeanspp function is our improved initial clustering method.
Results between encrypted K means and non encrpyted  K means can be compared by running two sets of functions

For rank > 2 our code is currently in development.

FOr proper results of our program please check our report.
